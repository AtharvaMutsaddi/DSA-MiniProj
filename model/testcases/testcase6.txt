hello atharvamutsaddi heres the summary of the videomeeting you requested this is basically saying it is just going to combine the usability of python with the performance of c so if you dont know with respect to c it is very fast right so that performance it wants to include in this programming language to know more about the mojo right  the talk of the town is about how it is different from python programming language and many more  mojo aspires to combine the usability of python with the speed of c  it is basically going to create this new programming language so as you all know python programming is a language basically people say that it is slow and obviously it is quite slow when compared to programming languages like c plus plus right  if we are able to get all the features  with respect to all the things it has all the functionalities it has  this will lead us to train our ai models very fast python is the favorite right now right now because it has a huge huge libraries right now  if you dont know guys the latner is also he has also developed this swift programming languages famous because it is very very fast right so this is the overall idea behind this  this year old startup this week announced two related projects that are coming up okay  one is mojo a programming language built on top of python that performance the performance of c  it will try to build some more additional features uh when compared to the python  the second thing that it is developing is a modular inference engine to run ai models rest expensively in production  this is specifically required what i believe right because right now if i really need to train a model it will replace python it will do multiple things it can replace multiple it can do uh you know that is the basically the future but understand one thing guys right there is a very important statement that has also been written the features that are going to get added in this module is going to take time right and how much time i dont know till then lets say if everything goes fine yes it has a chance that we as a data scientist or ai researcher we may use this for doing many things right there are also
